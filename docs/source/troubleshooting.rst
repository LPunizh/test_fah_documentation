Do I need administrator privileges to install the FAH client?
-------------------------------------------------------------
In most cases, yes. If you do not have administrator privileges or cannot access an administrator account, 
this indicates that you do not own or manage the computer. 
Most clients need to have some administrative access to complete the installation. 
If you do not have the rights, you are advised to ask for permission before going any further.

It is against the FAH End User License Agreement (EULA) to circumvent these restrictions without the expressed permission of the computerâ€™s owner. 
If you are the owner and do not know how to use administrator privileges, please ask someone with more experience to help you.
