WHAT WOULD MY DONATION OF FUNDS GO TO?
--------------------------------------
We are currently raising funds for new servers, to increase our server reliability. 
In general, we have needs both large (e.g. servers, graduate students, developers etc.) and small (memory, hard drives and backups). 
For example, we have to deal with over 500 terabytes of valuable scientific data, and more data comes in every day, 
all of which must be backed up and carefully preserved. This process is necessary, but quite expensive. Every little bit helps.
